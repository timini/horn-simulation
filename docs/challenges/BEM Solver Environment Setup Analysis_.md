# **Strategic Analysis and Resolution Pathways for BEM Solver Environment Setup on ARM64 Architectures**

## **1\. Executive Summary and Problem Validation**

### **1.1. Overview**

This report presents a comprehensive technical analysis and strategic resolution for the challenges encountered while establishing a Dockerized development environment for the horn-bem-solver on an ARM64-based host, specifically Apple Silicon. The investigation detailed in the user's query is both thorough and accurate; the conclusions drawn are correct. The failure to create a stable environment is not a result of user error or misconfiguration. Rather, it is the direct consequence of a significant architectural support gap within the scientific computing ecosystem, localized to a critical dependency: the bempp-cl library. This document validates those findings, provides a deeper analysis of the underlying technical causes, and outlines three distinct, actionable pathways toward a successful resolution.

### **1.2. Affirmation of the Core Challenge**

The central technical obstacle is the absence of officially supported, pre-compiled binary distributions of the bempp-cl library for the linux/arm64 (also known as aarch64) architecture.1 This deficiency is evident across key package managers, including Python's Package Index (PyPI) and the

conda-forge channel, which are the standard distribution mechanisms for such software. This stands in stark contrast to the project's other major dependency, fenics-dolfinx, which has demonstrated exemplary, mature support for multiple architectures, including linux/arm64.2 This fundamental disparity between the two required libraries is the primary source of the deadlock, rendering standard installation procedures ineffective on the target hardware.

### **1.3. Strategic Roadmap**

To navigate this impasse, this report elaborates on three primary strategic pathways, each with distinct trade-offs in terms of effort, performance, and long-term viability:

1. **Native Compilation:** This pathway involves meticulously building bempp-cl and its entire dependency stack from source code within a native linux/arm64 Docker environment. It represents the most robust and performant solution but demands the greatest initial investment in time and technical expertise.  
2. **Infrastructure Workaround:** This approach circumvents the native compilation requirement by leveraging linux/amd64 (x86\_64) infrastructure. This can be achieved either through emulation on the local ARM64 host or by using a native amd64 machine (local or cloud-based) for the Docker build process. This path offers a faster route to a working environment at the significant cost of performance and potential instability.  
3. **Ecosystem Pivot:** This strategy involves a critical evaluation of the project's dependencies and considers migrating from bempp-cl to an alternative Boundary Element Method (BEM) library that provides official, native support for the linux/arm64 architecture.

### **1.4. Final Objective**

The ultimate objective of this report is to provide the necessary depth of analysis, evidence, and step-by-step technical guidance to empower the selection and successful execution of the most suitable resolution strategy. The choice will depend on a careful consideration of project-specific constraints, including development timelines, computational performance requirements, available resources, and long-term maintenance goals.

## **2\. Deconstruction of the Architectural and Dependency Deadlock**

A granular analysis of the software ecosystem and the specific libraries involved reveals precisely why the attempted setup procedures failed. The issue is rooted in the uneven pace of adoption for the ARM64 architecture within the specialized domain of scientific computing.

### **2.1. The Scientific Python Ecosystem's ARM64 Transition**

The proliferation of ARM64-based hardware, most notably Apple Silicon in the consumer market and AWS Graviton processors in cloud computing, has initiated a significant architectural shift. For the scientific Python ecosystem, which is heavily reliant on foundational libraries written in C, C++, and Fortran, this transition is a complex and ongoing process.4

The primary distribution mechanism for Python packages is the Python Package Index (PyPI), which hosts pre-compiled binary packages known as "wheels." The availability of architecture-specific wheels is critical for a seamless user experience. When a user on a linux/arm64 system executes pip install \<package\>, pip searches for a wheel tagged for that architecture (e.g., ...-manylinux\_...\_aarch64.whl). If no such wheel is found, pip falls back to downloading the source distribution (.tar.gz) and attempts to compile it locally.5 This is the failure point observed in "Attempt 2." The compilation of complex scientific libraries from source is a non-trivial task that requires a complete development toolchain, including specific versions of compilers (C, C++, Fortran), build systems (CMake, Meson), and numerical libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, MPI), which are rarely present in a base container image.

The conda-forge community has been instrumental in bridging this gap. They have established a sophisticated cross-compilation infrastructure that allows building packages for osx-arm64 and linux-aarch64 on x86\_64 build machines.7 This effort has successfully brought a large number of packages to the ARM64 platform. However, with over 10,000 packages in the repository, this porting effort is not yet complete.7 The explicit absence of a

linux-aarch64 build for bempp-cl on conda-forge confirms it is one of the packages that has not yet completed this transition.1

### **2.2. A Tale of Two Libraries: A Comparative Architectural Analysis**

The core of the problem is best understood by directly comparing the architectural support of the two primary dependencies, fenics-dolfinx and bempp-cl.

| Library | Package Manager | linux/amd64 | linux/aarch64 | osx-64 | osx-arm64 | Snippet Evidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| fenics-dolfinx | Docker Hub | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | 2 |
| fenics-dolfinx | Conda-Forge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 3 |
| bempp-cl | Docker Hub | ✅ | ❌ | N/A | N/A | 10 |
| bempp-cl | Conda-Forge | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 1 |

#### **2.2.1. fenics-dolfinx: A Model of Cross-Platform Support**

The FEniCS Project has successfully navigated the architectural transition for its modern dolfinx library. Evidence of this is widespread and robust:

* **Docker Hub:** The official dolfinx/dolfinx and dolfinx/dev-env images are published as multi-arch manifests, explicitly supporting both amd64 and arm64.2 This is the gold standard for containerized distribution.  
* **Conda-Forge:** The fenics-dolfinx package is available for linux-aarch64 and osx-arm64, indicating that the conda-forge build recipes are mature and maintained for these platforms.3  
* **Community Confirmation:** User discussions on the FEniCS Discourse forum confirm that the Docker images run successfully on Apple M1 hardware.11

This evidence conclusively demonstrates that fenics-dolfinx is not the source of the environment setup problem and can be reliably installed on the target linux/arm64 architecture.

#### **2.2.2. bempp-cl: The Architectural Laggard and its Root Causes**

In contrast, bempp-cl lacks official support for ARM64. The table above shows no available packages for linux/aarch64 from either Docker Hub or conda-forge.1 The reason for this gap appears to be more complex than a simple lack of build resources; it is likely rooted in the library's core computational dependency:

PyOpenCL.

bempp-cl is a rewrite of the older BEM++ library, specifically designed to replace the C++ computational core with just-in-time (JIT) compiled kernels using either PyOpenCL or Numba.12

PyOpenCL provides high performance by leveraging GPUs and SIMD-optimized CPU instructions, but it introduces a hard dependency on the system's OpenCL drivers (the Installable Client Driver, or ICD).

The bempp-cl installation documentation contains critical warnings about this dependency. It explicitly states that **the Apple CPU OpenCL runtime is not compatible with bempp-cl**.10 While this refers to the native macOS (

darwin) environment, it reveals a fundamental sensitivity to the specifics of the underlying OpenCL implementation. Furthermore, the documentation warns of pocl (a popular open-source OpenCL implementation for CPUs) causing segmentation faults on x86\_64 systems when installed from conda, recommending the Intel runtime instead.10

This evidence strongly suggests that the lack of official linux/arm64 packages is not merely an oversight. It is highly probable that the available OpenCL drivers for the aarch64 architecture (such as pocl on ARM) exhibit similar or more severe instabilities when used with bempp-cl's JIT-compiled kernels. The maintainers have likely been unable to identify a stable, performant, and broadly available OpenCL backend on linux/arm64 that they can validate and support. Therefore, the problem is not just a packaging challenge but a deeper issue of ensuring computational correctness and stability on the target platform.

### **2.3. Post-Mortem of Environment Setup Attempts: A Technical Deep Dive**

With the architectural context established, the failure of each specific attempt can be explained with technical precision.

#### **2.3.1. Attempt 1: Using Pre-built bempp/bempp-cl-with-dolfinx Image**

The failure mode, ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bempp', despite the package being present in the image, is a classic Docker pitfall related to shell environments and Python virtual environments. High-level scientific packages are often installed into isolated environments (like conda or venv) to manage dependencies. The bempp/bempp-cl-with-dolfinx image almost certainly follows this pattern, placing its packages in a location like /dolfinx-env/.10

When a Docker container is run with a command, such as docker run... python my\_script.py, it executes the command using a non-interactive, non-login shell (typically /bin/sh \-c). This type of shell does not automatically source profile scripts like .bashrc or profile, where the conda activate or source /path/to/venv/bin/activate command would normally be placed. As a result, the python executable invoked is the one found in the system's default $PATH, not the one inside the activated virtual environment. The system Python has no knowledge of the packages installed within the isolated environment, leading directly to the ModuleNotFoundError.17 The user's correct attempt to add

RUN source /dolfinx-env/bin/activate to the Dockerfile only affects the environment of that specific RUN layer during the build process; it does not persist to the final CMD or ENTRYPOINT execution context of the running container. A proper solution requires modifying the ENTRYPOINT to explicitly call the correct Python executable (e.g., /dolfinx-env/bin/python) or to wrap the command in a shell script that first activates the environment.

#### **2.3.2. Attempt 2: Building from Source with pip**

This attempt failed with ERROR: No matching distribution found for fenics-dolfinx. This correctly identifies that no pre-built linux/arm64 wheel for fenics-dolfinx (or one of its many compiled dependencies) is available on PyPI. While conda-forge provides these packages, PyPI's support is less comprehensive. This forced pip to attempt a source build, which, as correctly surmised, would fail due to the missing chain of complex system-level dependencies.

#### **2.3.3. Attempt 3: Using a conda Environment**

This attempt failed with PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels: \- bempp-cl. This is the most direct confirmation of the core problem. It proves that the conda-forge channel, when queried for the linux-aarch64 architecture (the native architecture of the Docker build context), does not contain a package for bempp-cl.1

#### **2.3.4. Attempt 4: Using conda with Platform Emulation**

This final, sophisticated attempt failed with an internal conda error: TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType. This failure highlights the fragility of complex toolchains under CPU emulation. The command conda config \--env \--set subdir linux-64 forces conda's powerful dependency solver to operate for a foreign architecture (linux-64) while running on an emulated amd64 CPU (via QEMU).

The conda solver's logic involves intensive file system operations: creating cache directories, downloading package tarballs, checking hashes, and resolving complex dependency graphs by reading metadata files. It is highly likely that one of these low-level operations, when mediated by the QEMU emulation layer, is failing in a subtle way. For instance, a system call related to file path resolution or permissions might return an unexpected value, such as the None object in Python. This None is then passed to a subsequent function within conda's codebase that expects a file path (a string, bytes, or path-like object), triggering the TypeError.20 This indicates that the

conda toolchain itself is not fully robust to this specific mode of cross-architecture operation under emulation, representing an unsupported edge case that stresses the software beyond its tested limits.

## **3\. Actionable Strategies for a Functional BEM Environment**

The following sections transition from analysis to prescriptive, actionable solutions. Each pathway provides a detailed, tutorial-style guide to achieving a functional development environment.

### **3.1. Pathway 1: Native linux/arm64 Compilation from Source (The Definitive Solution)**

#### **3.1.1. Rationale**

This pathway is the most technically demanding but yields the most robust and desirable outcome: a fully native linux/arm64 Docker image. This approach eliminates all layers of emulation, guaranteeing the best possible performance and stability on ARM64 hardware. It provides complete control over the environment and ensures that the resulting software is optimized for the target architecture. While the initial effort is significant, the resulting Dockerfile is a durable asset that provides a reproducible and high-performance build process for the project's lifetime.

#### **3.1.2. Prerequisite System Dependencies**

A successful source build requires a comprehensive set of development tools and libraries to be installed in the base Docker image. The following apt-get command for a Debian-based image (e.g., ubuntu:22.04) installs the necessary compilers, build systems, and numerical libraries.

Dockerfile

\# Stage 1: Build Environment with all necessary dependencies  
FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS builder

ENV DEBIAN\_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install \-y \\  
    build-essential \\

    wget \\  
    unzip \\

    \# Other FEniCSx dependencies  
    libpugixml-dev \\  
    \# Cleanup  
    && rm \-rf /var/lib/apt/lists/\*

#### **3.1.3. Step-by-Step Build Guide**

The build must proceed in a specific order, satisfying the dependencies of each component before building the next.

1\. Create a Python Virtual Environment:  
It is best practice to install all Python packages into a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.

Dockerfile

RUN python3.10 \-m venv /opt/venv  
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"  
RUN python \-m pip install \--upgrade pip

2\. Build exafmm-t:  
bempp-cl can use exafmm-t for accelerated computations using the Fast Multipole Method (FMM).10 As it is not readily available as a package, it must be built from source.

Dockerfile

RUN git clone https://github.com/exafmm/exafmm-t.git /tmp/exafmm-t  
WORKDIR /tmp/exafmm-t  
RUN./configure && make \-j$(nproc) && make install  
RUN python setup.py install  
WORKDIR /

3\. Install Core Python Dependencies:  
Install the Python packages required by both fenics-dolfinx and bempp-cl using pip. pyopencl has linux-aarch64 packages on conda-forge, which is a strong indicator that it builds cleanly from source on this architecture.23

Dockerfile

RUN pip install numpy scipy numba meshio "gmsh\>=4.6.0" plotly pyopencl

4\. Build fenics-dolfinx:  
While conda packages are available, for a fully self-contained source-build Dockerfile, we will compile fenics-dolfinx from its source code. This involves compiling the C++ core first, followed by the Python interface.2

Dockerfile

\# Build DOLFINx C++ core  
RUN git clone https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx.git /tmp/dolfinx  
WORKDIR /tmp/dolfinx/cpp  
RUN mkdir build && cd build && \\  
    cmake.. && \\  
    make \-j$(nproc) && \\  
    make install

\# Install DOLFINx Python interface  
WORKDIR /tmp/dolfinx/python  
RUN pip install \-r build-requirements.txt  
RUN pip install \--no-build-isolation.  
WORKDIR /

5\. Build bempp-cl:  
With all prerequisites in place, the final step is to build bempp-cl itself.12

Dockerfile

RUN git clone https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl.git /tmp/bempp-cl  
WORKDIR /tmp/bempp-cl  
RUN pip install.  
WORKDIR /

#### **3.1.4. The Complete linux/arm64 Dockerfile**

Combining these steps into a multi-stage Dockerfile produces a clean, optimized final image. The builder stage contains all the development tools, while the final runtime stage copies only the necessary compiled artifacts and the Python virtual environment, resulting in a much smaller image size.

Dockerfile

    make \-j$(nproc) && \\  
    make install  
WORKDIR /tmp/dolfinx/python  
RUN pip install \-r build-requirements.txt  
RUN pip install \--no-build-isolation.  
WORKDIR /

\# Build and install bempp-cl  
RUN git clone https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl.git /tmp/bempp-cl

\# Prevent interactive prompts  
ENV DEBIAN\_FRONTEND=noninteractive

\# Install runtime dependencies

\# Set the PATH to use the virtual environment's executables  
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

\# Set a working directory for the application code  
WORKDIR /app

\# The container is now ready. The user can add their application code.  
\# For example:  
\# COPY./horn-bem-solver /app/horn-bem-solver  
\# CMD \["python", "horn-bem-solver/main.py"\]

### **3.2. Pathway 2: Leveraging x86\_64 Infrastructure (The Pragmatic Workaround)**

#### **3.2.1. Rationale**

This pathway prioritizes speed of setup over runtime performance. It is a pragmatic choice for unblocking initial development, enabling functional testing, and exploring the horn-bem-solver API without the immediate and significant effort of a full source build. It relies on using the well-supported linux/amd64 packages for bempp-cl and its dependencies.

#### **3.2.2. Option A: Build on a Native amd64 Host**

This is the most straightforward method. It involves using any machine with an x86\_64 CPU (such as a standard cloud VM or a different physical machine) to build the Docker image and push it to a container registry.

1. **Provision an amd64 Host:** Launch a small, inexpensive amd64-based virtual machine from any major cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2 t2.micro, GCP e2-micro, Azure B1s). Install Docker on this machine.  
2. **Create a Simplified amd64 Dockerfile:** This Dockerfile can leverage the pre-built packages from conda-forge, dramatically simplifying the process.  
   Dockerfile  
   \# Dockerfile for amd64 build  
   FROM continuumio/miniconda3:latest

   \# Install dependencies using conda from the conda-forge channel  
   RUN conda install \-y \-c conda-forge \\  
       fenics-dolfinx \\  
       bempp-cl \\  
       mpich \\  
       pyvista

   \# Set up the environment to be activated on login  
   SHELL \["conda", "run", "-n", "base", "/bin/bash", "-c"\]

   \# The rest of the Dockerfile to copy application code...  
   WORKDIR /app  
   \# COPY./horn-bem-solver /app/horn-bem-solver  
   \# ENTRYPOINT \["conda", "run", "-n", "base", "python", "horn-bem-solver/main.py"\]

3. **Build and Push the Image:** From the amd64 host, run the following commands:  
   Bash  
   \# Authenticate with your container registry  
   docker login your-registry.io

   \# Build the image  
   docker build \-t your-registry.io/your-repo/horn-bem-solver:latest.

   \# Push the image to the registry  
   docker push your-registry.io/your-repo/horn-bem-solver:latest

4. **Run on ARM64 Host:** On the local Apple Silicon machine, pull and run the image, explicitly specifying the platform to ensure Docker uses its emulation layer.  
   Bash  
   \# Pull the amd64 image  
   docker pull your-registry.io/your-repo/horn-bem-solver:latest

   \# Run the container with the platform flag  
   docker run \--platform linux/amd64 \-it your-registry.io/your-repo/horn-bem-solver:latest /bin/bash

#### **3.2.3. Option B: Cross-Platform Build with CI/CD**

This option automates the build process using a CI/CD service like GitHub Actions. It uses docker buildx and the QEMU emulator to build an amd64 image on a standard GitHub-hosted runner (which is typically amd64).

YAML

        with:  
          context:.

          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}  
          platforms: linux/amd64 \# Only build for amd64

This workflow automates the process from Option A, making it reproducible and integrated with the development lifecycle.24

#### **3.2.4. Critical Performance and Stability Analysis of Emulation**

It is imperative to understand that choosing Pathway 2 involves a significant compromise. Running amd64 binaries on an arm64 host via an emulation layer like QEMU (used by Docker Desktop) or Rosetta 2 is **not a transparent process and is not suitable for performance-critical work**.

* **Performance Degradation:** Emulation is computationally expensive. Every x86\_64 instruction must be translated into one or more ARM64 instructions at runtime. For CPU-bound scientific computing tasks, this overhead is substantial, often resulting in performance that is **an order of magnitude (or more) slower** than native execution.27 A build or simulation that takes minutes on a native machine could take hours under emulation.29  
* **Memory Overhead:** Emulated processes typically consume more memory than their native counterparts, which can be a constraint for large-scale simulations.31  
* **I/O Bottlenecks:** Filesystem I/O between the host and the emulated container is a well-known and severe performance bottleneck in Docker Desktop on macOS. This can dramatically slow down any process that involves frequent reading or writing of files.27  
* **Instability and Crashes:** Emulation is not always perfect. Complex applications can trigger edge cases in the emulator, leading to unexpected crashes or hangs. Low-level system features like inotify (used for file system change notifications) are known not to work correctly under QEMU, which can break development tools that rely on live-reloading.31

In summary, this pathway should be viewed strictly as a **development and functional testing workaround**. It allows for code to be written and tested for correctness, but any performance benchmarks or production runs must be conducted on native hardware.

### **3.3. Pathway 3: Exploring the BEM Library Ecosystem (The Strategic Pivot)**

#### **3.3.1. Rationale**

If the effort of a full source build (Pathway 1\) is prohibitive and the performance of emulation (Pathway 2\) is unacceptable, the most strategic long-term option is to pivot to an alternative BEM library that provides first-class, official support for the linux/arm64 architecture. This approach aligns the project with a more modern, cross-platform toolchain, potentially reducing long-term maintenance overhead. The key is to find a library that not only supports the architecture but also meets the specific physics requirements of the horn-bem-solver.

#### **Table: Comparative Analysis of Python BEM/FEM Libraries**

| Library | Primary Domain | Solved PDEs | linux/aarch64 Support | Maintenance Status | License | Snippet Evidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| bempp-cl | BEM (Acoustics, EM) | Laplace, Helmholtz, Maxwell | ❌ (No official packages) | Actively Developed | MIT | 1 |
| Capytaine | BEM (Hydrodynamics) | Linear Potential Flow | ✅ (PyPI wheels available) | Actively Developed | GPLv3+ | 32 |
| PyBEM2D | BEM (Potential Problems) | 2D Laplace | ❌ (No mention) | Less Active | Unspecified | 34 |
| BEM-3D-Python | BEM (Biofluids) | (Implied) Stokes Flow | ❌ (No mention) | Less Active | Unspecified | 36 |
| PySCeS | Systems Biology | ODEs (Not BEM/PDE) | ✅ (PyPI/Conda) | Actively Developed | BSD | 37 |
| PolyFEM | FEM | Laplace, Helmholtz, etc. | ✅ (Conda) | Actively Developed | MIT | 40 |

#### **3.3.2. In-Depth Candidate Profiles**

The table provides a filtered list of potential libraries. A deeper look reveals the most promising candidates.

* Top Candidate: Capytaine  
  Capytaine emerges as the strongest potential alternative. It is an actively maintained, Python-based BEM solver that explicitly provides pre-compiled wheels for ARM64 on PyPI (macosx\_14\_0\_arm64).33 The existence of these wheels is a powerful indicator that the library's toolchain is ARM64-compatible, and producing  
  linux/aarch64 wheels would be straightforward for the maintainers if not already available. The library's focus is on the simulation of wave-body interactions using linear potential flow theory.32 The critical step for this pathway is to evaluate whether the physics solved by  
  Capytaine is compatible with the requirements of the horn-bem-solver project. If the underlying equations of motion and boundary conditions align, Capytaine would offer a direct, high-performance, and easily installable solution on ARM64.  
* Filtering Out Non-Candidates  
  It is equally important to identify and discard unsuitable alternatives to avoid wasted effort.  
  * PolyFEM is an advanced and actively maintained library with excellent cross-platform support, including a conda package.40 However, it is a  
    **Finite Element Method (FEM)** library, not a BEM library.40 While it solves similar PDEs like Laplace and Helmholtz, the numerical methodology is fundamentally different, making it an unsuitable drop-in replacement for a BEM solver.  
  * PySCeS is also well-maintained with excellent ARM64 support.37 However, its domain is computational systems biology, and it is designed to solve systems of  
    **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**, not the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that BEM addresses.39  
* Other Possibilities  
  Libraries like PyBEM2D and BEM-3D-Python exist but appear to be more niche, academic projects with less active maintenance and no explicit mention of ARM64 support.35 They are likely to present the same, if not greater, architectural challenges as  
  bempp-cl.

## **4\. Synthesis and Final Recommendations**

### **4.1. Decision Framework**

The choice between the three pathways depends on a trade-off between project constraints. The following framework can guide the decision-making process:

* **If the primary goal is to unblock development immediately and performance is not a concern for initial work:**  
  * **Choose Pathway 2 (Leveraging x86\_64 Infrastructure).** This provides the fastest route to a functional, albeit slow, environment for code development and functional testing.  
* **If native performance on ARM64 is a non-negotiable requirement and the project is strictly tied to using bempp-cl:**  
  * **Choose Pathway 1 (Native linux/arm64 Compilation).** This is the only path that guarantees a high-performance, stable environment with the specified software stack. Be prepared to invest significant time in the initial build process.  
* **If long-term maintainability, ease of installation, and native performance are the highest priorities, and the project's physics are flexible:**  
  * **Choose Pathway 3 (Exploring the BEM Library Ecosystem).** This involves investigating Capytaine as a potential replacement. If it is a suitable match, this path offers the best long-term value by aligning with a modern, fully cross-platform library.

### **4.2. Expert Recommendation**

A hybrid, phased approach is recommended to balance immediate needs with long-term goals:

1. Short-Term Action (Immediate Priority):  
   Immediately pursue Pathway 2 (Leveraging x86\_64 Infrastructure). Use either a cloud VM or the GitHub Actions workflow to build a linux/amd64 image. This will unblock development within hours, allowing work on the horn-bem-solver application logic to proceed in parallel with other efforts. The performance limitations of emulation must be accepted during this phase.  
2. Long-Term Solution (Parallel Effort):  
   Simultaneously, begin work on Pathway 1 (Native linux/arm64 Compilation). Use the detailed Dockerfile provided in this report as a starting point. This is a substantial undertaking but is the definitive solution for achieving performance and stability with the required software stack. The resulting native image will be essential for any performance-critical analysis, benchmarking, or production use on ARM64 hardware.  
3. Contingency Plan:  
   If the source build in Pathway 1 encounters insurmountable obstacles—for example, if a critical dependency like exafmm-t proves to have deep-seated, unresolvable compilation issues on aarch64—then the focus should shift to Pathway 3 (Strategic Pivot). A thorough evaluation of Capytaine's suitability for the project's physics should be conducted. If it is a match, migrating to Capytaine becomes the most pragmatic long-term strategy.

### **4.3. Engaging with the Community**

It is highly recommended to engage with the bempp-cl open-source community. The developers are best positioned to provide insight into the official roadmap for ARM64 support.

* **Open an Issue or Discussion:** Post on the bempp-cl GitHub Issues page 43 or the Bempp Discourse forum.44  
* **Provide Context:** Clearly describe the problem, reference the findings in this report, and share the native-build Dockerfile. This provides valuable, concrete information to the maintainers.  
* **Ask Specific Questions:** Inquire about the known issues preventing an official linux/aarch64 release and whether there is a timeline for support. Reference the existing "Installing bempp on Apple M1 silicon" topic to connect with previous discussions.45

This engagement not only seeks a solution but also contributes valuable feedback to the open-source project, potentially accelerating the development of official ARM64 support for the benefit of the entire community.
