# Horn BEM Solver (Archived)

This package was initially created to house the Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver. However, due to the tightly coupled nature of the FEM-BEM simulation, the BEM logic has been integrated directly into the `horn-solver` package.

**This package is now considered redundant and is no longer in use.**

The coupled FEM-BEM logic can be found in the `horn-solver` package.
