# Horn BEM Solver

This package is intended to provide a Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver for the Horn project.

As of 2025-07-23, this package is under development. A major challenge has been the setup of a stable Docker environment with the required scientific computing libraries (`bempp-cl`, `fenics-dolfinx`) on an ARM64 architecture.

A detailed summary of the environment setup challenges can be found in `docs/challenges/02-bem-solver-environment-setup-challenges.md`.
