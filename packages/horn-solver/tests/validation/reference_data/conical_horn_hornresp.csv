# Cross-validation reference: Webster equation SPL for IJERT Type A conical horn
# Source: Geometry from Choudhari et al., IJERT Vol.3 Issue 2, 2014
#   "Theoretical, Simulation and Experimental Analysis of Sound Frequency
#    and Sound Pressure Level of Different Air Horn Amplifier"
# Reference SPL: Webster horn equation (analytical, 1D plane-wave approx)
# Geometry: conical frustum, throat_radius=0.005m, mouth_radius=0.0285m, length=0.25m
# BCs: Dirichlet p=1 at throat, Robin dp/dn=-jkp at mouth
# Speed of sound: 343 m/s
# Date generated: 2025-02-25
# Notes: Webster equation provides independent analytical reference for
#   a published horn geometry. FEM vs Webster tolerance = 6 dB (Tier 2).
#   The IJERT paper reports ANSYS simulation SPL of 97.34 dB at 1m for
#   Type A horn at resonance (~381 Hz), which is consistent with these
#   mouth-pressure SPL values when accounting for distance attenuation
#   and radiation efficiency differences.
