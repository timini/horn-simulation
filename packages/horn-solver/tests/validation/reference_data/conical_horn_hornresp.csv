# Community horn cross-validation reference data
# Source: [placeholder - add digitized data from published measurements]
# Geometry: conical horn, throat_radius=0.005, mouth_radius=0.0285, length=0.25
# Measurement conditions: 1W/1m, free-field
# Date digitized: [placeholder]
# Notes: This file is a placeholder. Add actual reference data as CSV columns below.
#
# To add data:
#   1. Digitize published frequency response from datasheet or paper
#   2. Record source, measurement conditions, and geometry in header comments
#   3. Columns: frequency_hz, spl_db
#   4. Update test_conical_horn_community.py geometry parameters to match
