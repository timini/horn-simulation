# Horn Solver Testing Strategy

## 1. Introduction

The results of a physics simulation are meaningless without a rigorous process to ensure their correctness. This document outlines the strategy for testing the `horn-solver` to build confidence in its outputs. Our approach distinguishes between two key concepts:

-   **Verification:** Are we solving the mathematical equations correctly? (i.e., is the code free of bugs and does it correctly implement the chosen numerical model?).
-   **Validation:** Are we solving the correct equations? (i.e., does our mathematical model accurately represent real-world acoustics?).

For the initial MVP, our focus is entirely on **Verification**. We must first prove that our solver correctly implements the physics before we can attempt to validate it against real-world measurements.

## 2. Verification Strategy: Method of Manufactured Solutions

The gold standard for verification is to test the solver against a problem with a known, exact analytical solution. For our case, we will use the **Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS)**, for which we will solve the acoustic problem for a simple geometry where the outcome is known.

### The Test Case: Plane Wave in a Duct

-   **Geometry:** A simple, straight, rectangular duct. We will use the existing `test_box.stp` for this, treating it as a section of a duct.
-   **Physics:** We will simulate a simple plane wave traveling down the length of theduct.
-   **Analytical Solution:** For a plane wave in a duct, the acoustic pressure `p` at any point `x` along the duct is given by a simple formula. If we impose a velocity at the inlet (x=0), the pressure is known everywhere.
-   **Test Data:** No external test data is required. The test itself will contain:
    1.  The simple geometry (`test_box.stp`).
    2.  The analytical formula for the plane wave.
    3.  The code to run the `dolfinx` solver on the geometry.
    4.  The code to compare the `dolfinx` result to the result from the analytical formula.

### How the Test Will Work

The `test_solver.py` will be updated to perform these steps:

1.  **Run Simulation:** Execute the `run_simulation_from_step` on the `test_box.stp` file for a single, known frequency.
2.  **Extract Numerical Result:** Read the output `.csv` file produced by the solver.
3.  **Calculate Analytical Result:** Using the known physical parameters (frequency, air density, speed of sound) and the plane wave formula, calculate the exact expected pressure at the measurement point.
4.  **Compare and Assert:** Compare the numerical result from the solver with the analytical result. They should match within a small tolerance (to account for numerical discretization error).

Passing this test will give us high confidence that the solver code is correctly implementing the physics of the Helmholtz equation.

## 3. Validation Strategy (Future Work)

Once the solver is **verified**, the next stage is **validation**. This involves comparing the simulation results to real-world data. This is out of scope for the current task but will be essential for the project's long-term success.

Future validation steps will include:

1.  **Physical Measurements:** Measure a real driver and horn combination with a calibrated microphone.
2.  **Model Physical Horn:** Accurately model the exact geometry of the measured horn.
3.  **Model Physical Driver:** Use the measured Thiele/Small parameters of the driver as input to the simulation.
4.  **Compare Results:** Compare the simulated SPL curve to the measured SPL curve. Discrepancies will inform refinements to the physics model (e.g., adding air viscosity, more complex boundary conditions).

By following this two-stage process—verification first, then validation—we can build a simulation tool that is not only functional but also trustworthy.
