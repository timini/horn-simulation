# 03: Simulation

**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task covered the implementation of placeholders for the core computational stages of the pipeline: meshing and solving.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Meshing Module**:
    - Implemented a placeholder `create_mesh` function in `meshing.py`.
    - Wrote unit tests to verify its behavior.
    - Integrated the meshing stage into the main pipeline.
- **Solver Module**:
    - Implemented a placeholder `run_simulation` function in `solver.py`.
    - Wrote unit tests for the solver placeholder.
    - Integrated the solver stage into the main pipeline, completing the simulation section's data flow.
- **E2E Verification**: Updated and verified the end-to-end test to ensure correct orchestration of the full data ingestion, geometry, and simulation workflow.

## Current Goal

The immediate goal is to implement the placeholder for the FEM/BEM solver. This involves creating the `
