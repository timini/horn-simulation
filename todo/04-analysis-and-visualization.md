# 04: Analysis, Scoring, and Visualization

**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task covered the final stage of the pipeline: processing the raw simulation output into meaningful metrics and visualizations.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Enhanced Solver Mock**: The `solver.py` placeholder was updated to generate a realistic mock CSV file, enabling robust testing of the analysis module.
- **Analyzer Module**: Implemented a placeholder `analyze_results` function in `analyzer.py` that reads the CSV, calculates mock metrics, and creates dummy plot files.
- **Unit Testing**: Wrote unit tests for the analyzer that cleverly use the solver's mock output as their input, ensuring the components work together.
- **Full Pipeline Integration**: Integrated the analysis stage into the main `run_pipeline` orchestrator.
- **Complete E2E Verification**: Updated the end-to-end test to verify the entire pipeline from start to finish, confirming that it correctly produces a final analysis report.

## Current Goal
The immediate goal is to implement a placeholder for the `analyzer.py` module. This involves creating an `
