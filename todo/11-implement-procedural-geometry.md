# 11: Implement Procedural Horn Geometry

**Date:** 2024-07-26

**Status:** Completed âœ…

## 1. Goal

To replace static STEP files with a dynamic, parametric geometry generation system.

## 2. Scope of Work

- **`horn-geometry` Package**: The `horn-geometry` package was created with a `generator.py` module.
- **Geometry Generator**: A `create_conical_horn` function was implemented using `gmsh` to generate a conical horn from parameters.
- **End-to-End Test**: The generated STEP file is used in the main Nextflow pipeline to run the simulation.

## 3. Key Decisions

- **CAD Kernel**: `gmsh`'s internal OpenCASCADE kernel was chosen for geometry generation.
- **Initial Profile**: A conical horn was implemented as the first parametric profile.
