# 07: Implement Real Solver Logic

**Status:** In Progress ðŸŸ¡

This task focuses on replacing the placeholder `solver.py` with a real implementation that uses `FEniCSx` to perform a FEM simulation. The BEM coupling with `Bempp` has been deferred.

## Key Accomplishments (Architecture Refactor)

- **Multi-Container Architecture**: After significant dependency conflicts (especially on `aarch64`), the project was refactored into a robust multi-container pipeline.
  - `horn-freecad-app`: A dedicated container for `FreeCAD`-based geometry generation.
  - `horn-solver-app`: A dedicated container based on the official `dolfinx` image for meshing (`Gmsh`) and solving (`FEniCSx`).
- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: The main `run_pipeline` function was rewritten to orchestrate `docker run` commands using `subprocess`.
- **Robust E2E Testing**: The end-to-end test was updated to mock `subprocess.run`, allowing it to verify the container orchestration logic without needing to run the actual containers.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Real Meshing**: Update `main.py` to call a `meshing.py` script inside the `horn-solver-app` container.
2.  **Implement Real Solver**: Update `main.py` to call a `solver.py` script inside the `horn-solver-app` container, passing it the generated mesh.
3.  **Refine Solver Logic**: Implement the actual FEM simulation logic inside `solver.py` using `dolfinx`.

# 08: Implement Full Horn Geometry

**Status:** Not Started âšª

This task involves moving beyond the proof-of-concept cylinder and implementing the real parametric geometry generation for various horn profiles (exponential, conical, etc.) using `FreeCAD`'s lofting capabilities.
