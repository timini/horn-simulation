# 07: Implement Advanced Solver Logic

**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task involved implementing advanced solver capabilities.

## Current Status

A FEM solver for the Helmholtz equation has been implemented using `dolfinx`. The more advanced BEM solver for the radiation boundary condition has been moved to its own TODO: `13-implement-bem-solver.md`.
