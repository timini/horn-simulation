# 07: Implement Real Solver Logic

**Status:** Not Started ⚪

This is the most complex computational stage. It involves replacing the placeholder `solver.py` with a real implementation that uses `FEniCSx` and `Bempp` to perform a coupled FEM-BEM simulation.

# 08: Implement Full Horn Geometry

**Status:** Not Started ⚪

This task involves moving beyond the proof-of-concept cylinder and implementing the real parametric geometry generation for various horn profiles (exponential, conical, etc.) using `FreeCAD`'s lofting capabilities.
