# 01: Project Setup and Driver Data
**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task covered the initial setup of the project structure and the implementation of a system for managing loudspeaker driver parameters.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Project Skeleton**:
    - Created a modular directory structure for packages (`packages/`) and tests (`tests`).
    - Set up `pyproject.toml` files for each package.
    - Added a `README.md` with project information and a `.gitignore` file.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
    - Established a TDD workflow with `pytest`.
- **Driver Data**:
    - Created a `drivers.json` file to store loudspeaker driver parameters.
    - Implemented a `get_driver_params.py` script to read driver data from the JSON file.
- **Data Access Testing**:
    - Wrote tests for the `get_driver_params` script to ensure data could be retrieved successfully.
