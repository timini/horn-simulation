# 02: Parametric Geometry Generation

**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task focused on implementing Stage 2 of the pipeline: generating a 3D model of the horn using programmatic CAD.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Parametric Generation**: Implemented a `create_conical_horn` function in `horn_geometry/generator.py` that uses `gmsh` to generate a STEP file from a set of parameters (throat radius, mouth radius, length).
- **Integration Testing**: Wrote integration tests using `FreeCAD` to validate the geometric properties of the generated STEP file.
- **E2E Integration**: Integrated the geometry generation stage into the main Nextflow pipeline.
