# 05: Implement Real Geometry Generation Logic

**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task focused on replacing the placeholder `horn_generator.py` with a real implementation that uses the `FreeCAD` scripting API to generate STEP files.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Docker Environment**: After a lengthy debugging process, a stable `Dockerfile` was created that provides a reproducible environment with `FreeCAD` and all necessary Python dependencies installed.
- **Real Implementation**: The `create_horn` function was updated to use the `FreeCAD` and `Part` APIs to generate a simple solid and export it to a real STEP file.
- **Mocked Unit Tests**: The unit tests for the geometry module were refactored to use `unittest.mock.patch`. This allows for testing the application logic without requiring a local `FreeCAD` installation, keeping the tests fast and portable.
- **Integration Testing**: A new integration test was created (`tests/integration/test_horn_geometry_integration.py`) that runs inside the Docker container to verify that the real `FreeCAD` API calls are successful and produce a valid output file.
- **E2E Test Adaptation**: The main end-to-end test was updated to mock the geometry generation stage, allowing it to continue verifying the overall pipeline orchestration in a local environment.

This completes the first step of implementing the real logic for the pipeline.

## Current Goal

The immediate goal is to create a Docker environment that includes `FreeCAD` and to modify the `create_horn` function to generate a simple geometric shape using the `FreeCAD` API.

## Plan

1.  **Create a Dockerfile**:
    - The first and most critical step is to create a `Dockerfile` that installs `FreeCAD` and all other necessary Python dependencies. This is essential for creating a reproducible and portable environment for this complex dependency.
    - We will use a base image that has `FreeCAD` pre-installed or install it via `apt` or `conda` within the Dockerfile.
2.  **Update `horn_generator.py`**:
    - Import the `FreeCAD` libraries (`FreeCAD`, `Part`).
    - Modify the `create_horn` function to generate a simple solid (e.g., a cylinder or a loft between two circles) using the `Part` workbench scripting API.
    - The function will then export the generated solid to a real `.stp` file in a designated output directory.
3.  **Refactor Tests**:
    - The existing unit tests rely on the placeholder's simple string output. These will need to be adapted.
    - We will **mock the `FreeCAD` module** for the unit tests (`tests/geometry/test_horn_generator.py`). This allows us to test the function's logic (e.g., that it calls the correct `FreeCAD` APIs with the right parameters) without needing to run `FreeCAD` itself.
4.  **Create Integration Test**:
    - Create a new integration test that runs *inside the Docker container*.
    - This test will call the `create_horn` function and verify that a valid, non-empty `.stp` file is actually created on the filesystem. This will be our true "end-to-end" test for the geometry generation stage.

## Next Steps

- Create the initial `Dockerfile` with a `FreeCAD` installation.
