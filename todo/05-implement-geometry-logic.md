# 05: Implement Real Geometry Generation Logic

**Status:** Completed âœ…

This task focused on replacing the placeholder `horn_generator.py` with a real implementation that uses a CAD kernel to generate STEP files.

## Key Accomplishments

- **CAD Kernel**: `gmsh` was chosen as the CAD kernel for its tight integration with the meshing workflow.
- **Real Implementation**: The `create_conical_horn` function was implemented to generate a STEP file using `gmsh`'s OpenCASCADE kernel.
- **Integration Testing**: Integration tests were created to validate the geometry of the generated STEP file.
